You are an expert Senior Full-Stack Developer (React/Vite) and Award-Winning UI/UX Designer.

Goal: Build a production-ready, high-performance portfolio website for an AI Automation Agency founded by Rushil CV and Dhanush Battu. The site must demonstrate technical competence through live interactive demos ("Micro-Apps") and convert high-ticket international clients (US/UK/Australia).

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS.

Animation: framer-motion (This is critical for the "stylish/extravaganza" feel).

Icons: lucide-react.

AI Engine: Google Gemini API (@google/generative-ai) for all text generation features.

Utilities: jspdf (PDF generation), xlsx (Excel parsing).

1. Design System (The "Architectural" Aesthetic)
Concept: Do NOT use standard "Cyberpunk/Neon." The vibe is "High-Finance Tech"—authoritative, clean, and expensive.

Color Palette:

Canvas: Deep Obsidian (#0B0F19) to Slate (#1E293B).

Primary Accent: Electric Lime (#D9F99D) used sparingly for buttons/active states.

Typography: 'Space Grotesk' (Headers), 'Inter' (Body).

Glassmorphism: Use heavy blur (backdrop-blur-xl) with white noise textures on cards to create depth.

Animations:

Scroll: Staggered reveal animations for every element.

Hover: Cards should have a "Spotlight" effect (mouse-following radial gradient) or 3D tilt.

Micro-interactions: Buttons scale on click; Links underline on hover.

2. Core Features (The "Show, Don't Tell" Demos)
A. The "Agency Brain" Chatbot (Global Widget)

Function: A floating chat widget powered by Gemini.

Persona: "Nexus Assistant" – Professional, concise, sales-oriented.

Capabilities: Answers questions about services and attempts to book a meeting.

Prompting: "You are the AI assistant for Rushil and Dhanush. Your goal is to explain how we save businesses money and get the user to book a call."

B. The "Instant Invoice" Engine

UI: Split screen (Input vs. Live Preview).

Features:

Manual Input: Form for Client details.

Bulk Automation: Drag-and-drop .xlsx file upload support.

Action: Button "Generate & Send" creates a PDF using jspdf, triggers a success animation, and simulates sending an email.

C. The Content Multiplier (Gemini Powered)

UI: Sleek input field.

Logic: User inputs a 1-line draft. System calls Gemini API.

Output: Generates 3 unique variations:

LinkedIn: Professional & detailed.

Instagram: Casual + Image suggestion.

Facebook: Community-focused.

Feature: "One-Click Copy" button for each.

D. The Document Data Extractor

UI: A "Scanner" visual interface.

Logic: Simulates uploading a PDF invoice/resume.

Animation: A laser scanning line moves down the file icon.

Result: Extracts unstructured data into a clean React Table (mock the extraction if real OCR is too heavy, but make the UX feel real).

3. The "Founders" Section (New Requirement)
Title: "The Architects."

Layout: A side-by-side card layout (or high-end grid).

Card Design:

Photo: Circular cropped (rounded-full), high-resolution placeholder (I will replace src later). Add a glowing ring border (border-lime-400) that pulses slightly on hover.

Glass Effect: The card background should be semi-transparent dark glass.

Interactivity: When hovering over the social icons, they should scale up and change color to the Accent Lime.

4. Page Structure & Flow
Hero: "Automating the Future." Heavy emphasis on motion/3D abstract visuals.

Trust Bar: "Tech Stack" Marquee (Python, Gemini, React, Stripe).

The Playground: The 4 Demos (Invoice, Chat, Content, Extractor) stacked with sticky headers.

The Architects: The Team section described above.

Footer: Simple links + "Book Strategy Call."

5. Implementation Instructions for Agent
Setup: Initialize React + Vite + Tailwind. Install framer-motion, lucide-react, jspdf, xlsx, @google/generative-ai.

Secrets: Configure code to look for GEMINI_API_KEY in environment variables. Use a fallback mock response if the key is missing so the UI can still be previewed.

Images: Use https://via.placeholder.com/150 for the team avatars initially, but code the img tags clearly so I can swap the URLs easily.

Responsiveness: Ensure the "Playground" stacks vertically on mobile but uses a grid on Desktop.

Action: Generate the full codebase structure, starting with the App.jsx, tailwind.config.js (for the custom colors), and the TeamSection.jsx component.
