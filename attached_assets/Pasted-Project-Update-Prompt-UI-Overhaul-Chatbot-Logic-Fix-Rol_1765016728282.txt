Project Update Prompt: UI Overhaul & Chatbot Logic Fix
Role: Senior Frontend Engineer & UI/UX Specialist. Objective: Refactor the Playground section and ChatBot component to achieve a "Minimalist Architectural SaaS" look. The current UI is too cluttered. We need whitespace, distinct separation, and premium contrast.

Action Plan:

1. Fix the Chatbot (Priority Logic & Layout)
Positioning: Move the floating chat trigger button to the Bottom Right (bottom-6 right-6 fixed).

Window Alignment: The Chat Window must anchor to the Bottom Right as well (aligned with the button).

Auto-Open Logic:

In the ChatBot component, use a useEffect.

Set a timer for 2.5 seconds after the page loads.

Automatically set isOpen to true after this delay so the user is greeted without clicking.

Styling: Remove the generic borders. Use a high-end "Messenger" style:

Header: Deep Obsidian with a Lime Green "Online" dot.

Bubbles: User = Dark Gray; Bot = White text on dark background (or subtle accent color).

2. The Playground UI Overhaul (The "Clean" Look)
Current issue: The cards are too wide and cramped. New Design Requirement: Refactor the "Playground" container into a single-column stack with massive vertical spacing (gap-12), or a Bento Grid (if space permits).

Specific Component Rewrites:

A. Refactor InvoiceGenerator.jsx (Visual Polish)

Structure: Create a distinct "Card" with a 1px border (border-white/10) and backdrop-blur-2xl.

Layout: Use a grid: grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-8.

Left (Inputs): clean, spaced-out inputs. Remove the standard HTML look. Use: bg-transparent border-b border-gray-700 focus:border-lime-400 outline-none p-2. Labels should be small and uppercase (text-xs tracking-widest text-gray-400).

Right (Preview): This is the most important part.

Visual: Render a Literal White Paper div inside the dark card (bg-white text-black rounded-sm shadow-xl p-6).

Effect: This contrast (White paper on Dark app) creates the "Professional" feel.

Typography: Use a serif font for the "Invoice" header inside this preview to look like a legal document.

B. Refactor ContentMultiplier.jsx

Input: Make the input field massive. It should look like a "Prompt Box" (Height: 16, centered text).

Output Cards: Instead of a text list, render 3 distinct "Social Cards":

LinkedIn Card: White/Gray bg, Blue icon, professional font.

Instagram Card: Gradient border, Image placeholder square, hashtag highlighting.

Twitter Card: Black bg, white text, minimal.

C. Refactor DataExtractor.jsx

Dropzone: Make it look like a technical schematic. dashed border (border-dashed border-2 border-gray-600), centered icon, "Drag & Drop PDF" text.

Result Table: If data is present, hide the dropzone and show a clean data table with distinct rows (border-b border-gray-800).

3. Global Aesthetics (Typography & Spacing)
Headers: All tool headers ("Instant Invoice Engine", etc.) must use the font Space Grotesk or similar. Size: text-2xl. Color: text-white.

Subheaders: text-gray-400, text-sm.

Container: Ensure the main Playground section has max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-20. Padding is luxury.

Execution Instruction: Rewrite the ChatBot, InvoiceGenerator, ContentMultiplier, and DataExtractor components with these exact Tailwind styles. Ensure the Chatbot opens automatically on the right side. Do not preserve the old "cramped" layout.
